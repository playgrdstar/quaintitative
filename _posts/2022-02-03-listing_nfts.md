## Listing NFTs

Since everybody (and their dogs) are listing NFTs, I thought I should just do it too, just to understand what is involved, and hopefully learn something useful from the process.
And since I will almost certainly forget what what went through my mind during this process, I decided to jot down some notes on the key points that I learnt or went through my mind. I'm not very hopeful about selling any of my NFTs, given how crowded the marketplaces have become in the short span of a year or so, so this would be my main takeaway from it.

Some of these points could potentially be wrong, or outdated, so please let me know if so.

I am going to assume everyone has a basic understanding on what a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is. _TLDR: unique (i.e. not fungible) content or data stored on the blockchain._ If not, there are plenty of references on the net on this, like [this][6].

### Content ###

The starting point is of course to create the content or items that you would like to list. For me, I had [digital illustrations][4] and [code][5] lying around, so it was really a matter of curating them into coherent _collections_ of items. 

NFTs can be minted from physical/tangible items too. If you have, say actual collectibles lying around, you could mint a digital version of that item and send the collectible to the buyer of the NFT. The NFT is then a digital immutable record of the transaction taking place (maybe alongside some metadata on it, and an image of the item).

Note that I highlighted _collections_ of items, rather than individual items. It is of course possible to list individual NFTs, or even individual NFTs in collections of others, so why build collections of your own? 

From my perspective, there are a few advantages. First, costs. We will go into this later, but there are costs (gas fees) associated with listing NFTs, and doing it as a collection enables economies of scale. From what I understand and experienced, you will usually pay a one-time gas fee for the first item you sell in a collection, but not the subsequent ones in the collection if you are doing 'lazy-minting'. Do note that gas fees will still apply when you finally sell it though. Second, a collection makes for a more coherent proposition to buyers, as it allows you to develop or create a series of related works that buyers may be interested in, similar to how people collect trading cards with a specific theme. Third, everyone seems to be doing it, so I will just follow the herd.

For me, because of my dual interests in illustration and generative art, I put together two collections on [OpenSea][1], which you can find at these links - illustrations in [Whimsical Ether Reality][2], and generative art videos in [Ethereal Attractors][3].

### Platform ###

Next, where to mint and list the NFT. There are many platforms available. Most operate on the ethereuem blockchain (ETH), like [OpenSea][1] and many [others][7]. [Solanart][8] seems to another interesting marketplace, that is on the Solana blockchain. For this first attempt, I decided on OpenSea, as it seems to have the greatest reach. I think deciding on a marketplace should probably be based on factors like reach (based on the number of people who frequent the marketplace), fit (with the nature of your content or items) and cost (from service charges and gas fees), but I shall not delve too much into those for now, since there are probably resources on these considerations available via a simple Google search.
