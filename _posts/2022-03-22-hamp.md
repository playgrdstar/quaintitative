## Building AI models for Learning User Interface Designs

The research for my PHD thesis focuses on the learning of dynamic multimodal networks. Ever since I selected this as my research area, I started seeing such networks everywhere around me.

One of the places where I found such networks is in the domain of user interfaces (UI) (the other is finance, which I will touch on sometime in the future). If you are familiar with either designing or coding a UI, you will probably realize that each UI is actually comprised of many different objects composed together. Objects could be UI elements such as text boxes or images, or even the text within the text boxes. UI objects do not exist in isolation hence share different relationships with each other, e.g., with applications that they are a part or; with their neighbouring elements; with elements within each of them. If you look at the figure below, you will get an idea of the different inter-linked UI elements in a UI screen.
