## Generative Coding - The Nature of Code Ported to Three.js 

Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code [book][1] introduced me to the world of generative coding. This port of his Nature of Code examples to three.js is kind of my homage to the book.

I've not reproduced every single example, but rather the key ones in each chapter. These should be more than enough for anyone to understand how to code all his examples in three.js.

I've also not followed the styles and colors faithfully, but rather added some of my own flourishes.

The listing is below. First link in each set is the demo, and the second link is the github repo with the code.
