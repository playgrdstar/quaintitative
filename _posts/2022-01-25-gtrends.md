## Extracting and Processing Google Trends data

This is a short and sweet writeup on one way of downloading data from Google Trends, which can be useful for spotting or monitoring trends. I use the library made available [here][1]. First, install pytrends.
```
pip install pytrends
```

The steps thereafter are simple. Say, we want to find trends relating to the cashtags of specific stocks, we can just run these steps.
```
selected_ticker = ['$AAPL']
sel_ticker_trends = pytrends.get_historical_interest(selected_ticker, 
                                                year_start=2020, month_start=1, day_start=1, hour_start=0, 
                                                year_end=2020, month_end=1, day_end=2, hour_end=0, 
                                                cat=0, geo='', gprop='', sleep=60)
```

Or if we want to find trends relating to specific keywords.
```
kw_list = ['singapore', 'singaporean']
keyword_trends = pytrends.get_historical_interest(kw_list, 
                                            year_start=2021, month_start=1, day_start=1, hour_start=0, 
                                            year_end=2021, month_end=1, day_end=2, hour_end=0, 
                                            cat=0, geo='', gprop='', sleep=60)
```

The [notebook][2] here has the full code.


And that's it. Happy data explorations!
