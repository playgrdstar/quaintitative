## 3 Days of Hand Coding Visualisations - Introduction

I have been doing a simple beginner’s course on hand coding visualisations at work. 

A wide range of tools are available for visualising data, from the ubiquitous Excel to the very user friendly (but not cheap) Tableau. 

But I thought it would still be useful to do a short course on how to hand code visualisations, and the range of ways in which to do that. There are a number of advantages in choosing the hand coding route. 
- It’s free. Even Excel costs $, not to mention Tableau, where the costs can run into the thousands.
- It’s flexible. You are not limited to the chart types that Excel or Tableau offers. Almost anything you can imagine can be coded, and interactions built in.
- It’s easy to show off your creations. Anyone with a web browser will be able to view and interact with your data visualisation.

The original course is about 1.5 days long. 

I shall split it into 3 parts, that even someone with very little coding knowledge could cover in 3 days. 

At the end, you would hopefully have gained a good knowledge on the range of tools available for hand coding visualisations, and be able to create the visualisation shown below, which can be accessed at this [link][1].
