## Hello
### I'm Gary Ang, or Ming

I'm currently a PHD (in Computer Science) student at the Singapore Management University. My research relates to deep learning, specifically in the area of multimodality and networks/graphs.
I am also an illustrator, and generative artist. My background is in engineering, as well as quantitative finance. More details on my background, art, and research can be found in my social links on the left.

I use this blog to document, as well as share topics relating to code, data science, machine and deep learing, sprinkled with the occasional personal thoughts. :)

If you wish to connect, feel free to email  me at playgrdstar@gmail.com.
